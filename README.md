## General Information
- We aim to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based model with the capability to accurately identify cases of melanoma. Melanoma, a form of skin cancer, can pose a severe threat if not detected at an early stage, constituting a significant portion of skin cancer-related fatalities (about 75%). The implementation of a solution capable of analyzing images and promptly notifying dermatologists about the presence of melanoma holds the potential to mitigate substantial manual effort currently involved in the diagnostic process.
- Our project focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques, specifically a CNN architecture, to address the critical problem of melanoma detection. The background of our endeavor is rooted in the urgency to enhance early diagnosis capabilities, thereby potentially saving lives and improving patient outcomes. By building an efficient model, we intend to streamline the diagnostic workflow for dermatologists and facilitate quicker interventions.
- Business Problem :
The core business problem we are addressing is the timely and accurate identification of melanoma cases. Detecting melanoma is pivotal due to its life-threatening implications, and automating this process can drastically reduce the time and effort required for manual evaluation. Our model aims to assist dermatologists by providing prompt alerts about potential melanoma occurrences, leading to improved patient care and efficient resource allocation.
- What is the dataset that is being used?
For this project, we are utilizing a comprehensive dataset of skin images that includes various types of skin lesions, including melanoma. This dataset enables our model to learn and recognize distinct features associated with melanoma. By training on diverse examples, we seek to develop a robust model capable of making accurate predictions when presented with new, unseen images. The availability of this dataset is pivotal for achieving our project's objective of creating an effective melanoma detection tool.
